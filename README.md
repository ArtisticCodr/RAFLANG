# RAFLANG
This is an interpreter that is used with my own grammar (RAFLANG). <br>
RAFLANG is a programming language that beginners can use in programming,
it therefore contains all the basic functionalities of each programming language:<br>

- data types / variables (numbers, characters, strings)<br>
- mathematical operations<br>
- logical operations<br>
- bit operations<br>
- if - else command<br>
- while command (break, continue)<br>
- for command (break, continue)<br>
- functions<br>
- auxiliary libraries (stdin / stdout, working with files, strings ...)<br><br>

--The program works with python3 and java--<br>
python3 is used as the backend language and the frontend editor is written in java

# Executable
[here](https://github.com/filiph-r/RAFLANG/tree/master/exec) is the link to the executable jar file and some code samples written in raflang. The Interpreter folder needs to be in the sam directory as the jar when executing.

# Note
This Project was written as a part of the course "Program Translators" at The Faculty Of Computer Science in Belgrade.
